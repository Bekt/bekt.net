# Programming Puzzles

I used to be into programming competitions and puzzles a lot when I was in
high school and first two years of college.

Eventually, I want to display all the solved problems with links to the solution
code in this page. However, for now I am just including links to relevant pages.

[Bekt/Programming-Competitions](https://github.com/Bekt/Programming-Competitions/)
contains my solutions to some of the problems.

## UVa Online Judge

>[UVa Online Judge](uva.onlinejudge.org) is an online automated judge for programming problems hosted
>by University of Valladolid. Its problem archive has over 4300 problems and
>user registration is open to everyone.
>
>There are currently over 100000 registered users.
>A user may submit a solution in ANSI C (C89), C++ (C++98), Pascal, Java or C++11

View my statistics on the UVa site:  [webo](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_authorstats&userid=131092)


## Programming Challenges

>[Programming Challenges](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0387001638) book is a delight for
>anyone who appreciates good problems, or who has an interest in problem solving, data structures, or algorithms.
>
>Fourteen chapters are included in the book, each of which deals with a different category of problems and
>algorithms. Within each chapter is a survey of the category of problems and the algorithms to solve them, followed
>by several problems in the category that have appeared in various programming contests.

Some problems overlap with the UVa problems, but someday I will post my statistics from
[programming-challenges.com](http://www.programming-challenges.com) as they do not have a public profile page.

## Project Euler

>[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series
>of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs.
